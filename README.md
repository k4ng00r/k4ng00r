# 🦘 KANGOOR JOSHUA BROWN — CODE PRICE LIST 💸  
**“I don’t code for passion, mate. I code for rent.”**  

Every `return` pays for coffee.  
Every `if` keeps the fridge running.  
Every `function` gets me one step closer to flying back to Australia.  

This is the official **Kangur Dev Ratecard** —  
a breakdown of my blood, caffeine, and logic in **PLN NETTO per hour**.  
Built on tears, cheap vodka, and 46 functions that barely compile but always work.

!!!IMPORTANT STATEMENT!!!

KANGUR IS TRULY MANUAL CODING PROJECT - NO USAGE OF CHAT GPT OR DUPLICATING STACK OVERFLOW SOLUTIONS*

## 🦘 Kangur Dev Summary
If it compiles — I drink.  
If it throws — I drink faster.  
If it passes tests — I raise the hourly rate.  

**Current standing rate: 45 PLN NETTO/h**  
**Current emotional cost: incalculable.**
